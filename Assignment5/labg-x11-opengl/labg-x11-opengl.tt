This is a non-credit lab, in preparation for an upcoming project which
will involve using OpenGL, which is a graphics toolkit.  There is
nothing to submit, and it will not be graded.  In order to run an X11
application on the server, and have it display on your own worksta-
tion, you will need to install an X11 running on your computer.

1.  Unix Timeshare: X2Go

X2Go allows you to access a remote graphical desktop over a low
bandwidth connection.  In otherwords, you can use X2Go to login to the
Unix timeshare in a graphical fashion instead of using a command line.
It is similar to the X11 (or XWindows) system that use XDMCP (or SSH)
to view a remote desktop.  X2Go is availble on multiple platforms, so
simply pick the client that works best for you.  More information can
be found on the X2Go website:  https://wiki.x2go.org/

2.  Installing X11

Depending on what personal computer you use, choose one of the
following methods of installing X11.

 (a) X11 on Linux.  X11 is the native windowing system used on Linux.
     You may use any window manager of your choice.

 (b) X11 on OSX.  The Macintosh OSX operating system is based on BSD
     (the Berkeley Systems Distribution of Unix).  Install XQuartz if
     you do not already have X11 running on your personal workstation.
     https://www.xquartz.org/

 (c) X11 on W*nd*z*.  There are some choices:  Xming.  Cygwin.

     https://www.cygwin.com/

3.  Verifying X11

Once X11 has been installed on your computer, verify that it is
working.  When running an X11 program repomely but displaying on the
local workstation, it is necessary to set up X11 forwarding with the
-X flag of ssh, as in:
   bash-1$ ssh -X username@unix.ucsc.edu

One may run an X11 program by typing the command name, usually by
backgrounding the process, as in the following.  Note the ampersand
(&).

   bash-2$ gv &
   bash-3$ xev &
   bash-4$ xpdf &

4.  Running OpenGL programs

In the subdirectory hello-world there are several OpenGL programs
available for testing.  If your workstation has X11 properly
installed, they can just be run as any other X11 program.  Example:
   bash-5$ glxgears &

Problems?  Because of incorrect configuration of OpenGL on the server,
it is possible that you might see the following message:

   bash-6$ glxgears &
   libGL error: No matching fbConfigs or visuals found
   libGL error: failed to load driver: swrast
   Error: couldn't get an RGB, Double-buffered visual

The following statement in your .bash_profile might solve that
problem:

   export GLES_MESA=/usr/local/android-sdk/emulator/lib64/gles_mesa
   export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$GLES_MESA

5.  Hello, World!

The subdirectory hello-world/ contains some sample programs.  You are
not expected to understand the code in these programs at this time,
but you should run the programs to verify that you can.  at the end of
the line.  Three of the programs draw flags on the screen.  You can
move them around and resize them.

   bash-7$ bonjour-le-monde &
   bash-8$ ciao-mondo &
   bash-9$ hallo-welt &
   bash-10$ konnichiwa-sekai &

The program hello-world can also be moved around and resized, and it
also reacts to inputs you give it.

   bash-11$ hello-world &
   To cycle the colors: right mouse button or key 'c' or 'C'.
   To cycle the fonts: left mouse button or key 'f' or 'F'.
   To cycle the greetings: middle mouse button or key 'g' or 'G'.
   To invert the colors: key Backspace, Return, or Delete.
   To quit: key 'q' or 'Q' or ESC.

6.  Other tests

For other tests of OpenGL, look in the directory other-tests and run:

   bash-12$ glclock &
   bash-13$ color-wheel &
   bash-14$ teapot &

The last one shows a teapot picture both in a solid view and a wire
frame.  Every time you press the left mouse button the view get
swapped.

7.  Installing a local OpenGL

Running OpenGL across the internet will be net-intensive, especially
if you have a slow internet connection.  So you might want to install
OpenGL on your own workstation.
   http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

Once you have installed OpenGl on your own workstation, you may copy
the files from this code subdirectory onto your own workstation and
compile them.  Depending on the OS you are using, you may have to
change the line
   #include <GL/freeglut.h>
to something else, for example:

   #ifdef __linux__
   #include <GL/freeglut.h>
   #endif
   #ifdef __macosx__
   #include <??????????>
   #endif

The #ifdefs detect which operation system you are using and will then
include the appropriate header files, thus possibly leading to a
portable program.  You need to figure out what the predefined macro
identifying your OS, and where the OpenGL header files are.

8.  Other references

When looking for documentation on a particular function, look at
https://www.opengl.org/.  For example, to find out about the function
glutPostRedisplay, type ``OpenGL glutPostRedisplay'' into Google, then
select www.opengl.org.

9.  Alternatives

Instead of installing X11 on your workstation, you may do your
development in the lab.  Instead of installing OpenGL on your
workstation, you may work remotely and run all OpenGL programs on the
timeshares.
