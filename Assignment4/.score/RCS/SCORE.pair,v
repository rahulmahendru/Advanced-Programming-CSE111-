Grader: If the student is working alone, ignore this file and
do not deduct any points described here.  If the students are
working in a pair, grade *ONLY* one of the pair's work.

Make a *relative* symlink in the non-graded partner's directory
called SCORE pointing at the SCORE file in this directory.  Do
not copy the SCORE file.  Create the symlink via:
.   ln -s ../(partner)/SCORE
where (partner) is the partner's actual username.  After that,
ls -la should show something like
.   lrwxr-xr-x   17 Jun 10 18:04 SCORE -> ../(partner)/SCORE

(2) Did both partners' names and usernames appear in a comment
    at or near the top of all text files submitted (except
    see below for PARTNER file)?

(2) Did they both submit a README which contained the required
    contents?  Deduct the full 2 points if either partner
    did not.

(6) Was the PARTNER file exactly correctly formatted?
    Use partnercheck to verify this.  Both partners must have
    a PARTNER file pointing at each other for either of them
    to get these points.  Both users' PARTNER files must be
    reported as valid by the partnercheck script.  Deduct the
    full 6 points if either partner did not.

These files must be spelled README and PARTNER, respectively,
in exactly that way, in upper case.  Add up the negative points
above and enter that on the TOTALPAIR line.

TOTALPAIR=
.between -10 and 0, inclusive.

In the SCORE file, reduce TOTALSCORE by TOTALPAIR.
